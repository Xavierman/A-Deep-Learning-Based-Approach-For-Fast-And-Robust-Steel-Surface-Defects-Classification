### Introduction
In this paper, we present a compact yet effective convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which emphasizes the training of low-level features and incorporates multiple receptive fields, to achieve fast and accurate steel surface defect classification.Our proposed method adopts the pre-trained SqueezeNet as the backbone architecture.We also construct a diversity-enhanced testing dataset of steel surface defects to evaluate the robustness of classification models. The dataset contains severe camera noise, non-uniform illumination, and motion blur.

### Enhanced Dataset
The enhanced dataset is build on NEU dataset:
A noise robust method based on completed local binary patterns for hot-rolled steel strip surface defects
